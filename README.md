Software to Share Photos, Video, and Music (not copyrighted material)

Developed as a campus wide resource to allow students, faculty and staff to contribute and then share images, video, and music for academic and research purposes, so as not to use otherwise copyrighted material, it is now released to the larger community for implementation perhaps in a similar or other setting where authors of content would like to share media of their communal creation.
